# Computer Science Class Portfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Class Portfolio! This repository showcases my classwork in a computer science class where Scala was the primary language used. It serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and software development using Scala.

## Lecture Questions

In this section, you will find the code for lecture questions. These questions are designed to enhance our understanding of various computer science concepts and practice problem-solving skills. The code included in this section is organized based on the topics covered during the course. Each question typically includes a prompt and a solution written in Scala.

Here are a few examples of the lecture questions covered in this repository:

- [Question 1](lectures/question1.scala): Description of the question and corresponding solution.
- [Question 2](lectures/question2.scala): Description of the question and corresponding solution.
- [Question 3](lectures/question3.scala): Description of the question and corresponding solution.

Feel free to explore the [lectures](lectures/) directory to access the code for other lecture questions.

## Projects

This section contains the projects completed during the computer science class. These projects allowed us to apply the concepts we learned and develop practical skills in software development using Scala. Each project is organized in its own directory and includes a README file with detailed information about the project and its implementation.

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

- [Project 1](projects/project1/): Description of the project and its goals.
- [Project 2](projects/project2/): Description of the project and its goals.
- [Project 3](projects/project3/): Description of the project and its goals.

Feel free to explore the [projects](projects/) directory to access the code and documentation for each project.

## Showcase of Scala Skills

This portfolio serves as a testament to my Scala skills and my ability to apply them to solve various problems and complete projects. The code included in this repository demonstrates my understanding of functional programming, object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and more.

I have strived to write clean, efficient, and well-documented code that adheres to Scala best practices and principles. Each code file and project folder includes comprehensive comments and explanations to facilitate understanding and showcase my thought process.

Feel free to explore the code in this repository to gain insight into my Scala skillset and problem-solving abilities.
